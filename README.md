This is a game in early development.

It relies heavily on procedural generation, much of which occurs at runtime as the
player navigates the world. The terrain is generated by semi-intelligent autonomous
"ants" that wander around and interact with their environment. These ants leave
"trails" of navigable blocks, which can be arbitrarily large and complex. They
can create mazes, buildings, cities, landscapes that mimic mountains or forests,
as well as bizarre shapes and twisted structures that defy all reason.
